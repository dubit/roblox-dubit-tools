# Getting Started with Wally

:::note
This document assumes that you already have the Wally package manager installed on your system.
:::

## Generating the Wally Configuration file

To get started with a *Wally* project, please execute the `wally init` command through a terminal under your projects directory;

```bash
C:\..\project-name> wally init
```

This command should generate a base `wally.toml` file that we can use to add dependencies into our project.

## Adding dependencies
