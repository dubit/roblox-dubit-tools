# Totalizers
The community goals/totaliser tool is a tool that allows us to create some sort of value that can be written to,
and read from - from all Servers within a Roblox experience.

This is useful in cases where you want to track something, for example - if you’re in an shooter game and want
to track how many kills all players have made throughout the lifetime of the experience, you’re able to do that.
Alongside this, we could use this value to award community members with free in-game items.

For example, tracking how many players have liked and joined the group, and once 1000~ players have, award
players 1000 in game cash!
