# Ugc-Toolkit
The UGC Toolkit should be a suite/library of functions that enable developers to implement common functions that we normally assign the 3d podiums/UGCs in our experiences.

To be clear, this package isn’t responsible for setting a UGC podium up, because this would require us creating a framework which is capable of handling all the edge cases, which falls out of scope for this package because it’s not a framework. 

The implementation of a UGC podium is still up to the developer, this library just makes state/functionality
surrounding this podium easier
